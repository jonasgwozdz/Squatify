# Squatify

## Overview
Squatify is a tiny little tool designed for motion tracking and data logging during squats. It takes videos of people performing squats, tracks their motion, and exports this data into CSV files. This data is particularly useful for training neural networks in applications such as fitness coaching, physical therapy, and biomechanical analysis.

## Features
- **Video Processing**: Process videos to track squatting motion.
- **Motion Tracking**: Accurate tracking of key points during the squat.
- **Data Export**: Export motion data into well-structured CSV files.
- **Neural Network Training**: Data formatted for ease of use in training machine learning models.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` (there are non)

### Installation
Clone the repository and run the main.py. it's that simple. You have to see it to believe it.

##Usage

Record or upload a squatting video, name it "VideoXX"( with a corresponding number) and put it into the Viedos directory.
Run the motion tracking script: python main.py.
Collect the output CSV files from the designated output folder.
