# Squatify

## Overview
Squatify is a tiny little tool designed for motion tracking and data logging during squats. It takes videos of people performing squats, tracks their motion, and exports this data into CSV files. This data is particularly useful for training neural networks in applications such as fitness coaching, physical therapy, and biomechanical analysis.

## Features
- **Video Processing**: Process videos to track squatting motion.
- **Motion Tracking**: Accurate tracking of key points during the squat.
- **Automatic Labeling**: Machine Learning based labeling of the Squat motion.
- **Data Export**: Export motion data into well-structured CSV files.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9.6
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation
Clone the repository, install the required packages, find some videos of someone squatting and run the cells in the [Squatify.ipynb](Squatify.ipynb).

## Usage
Run the [Squatify.ipynb](Squatify.ipynb) to analyse a recorded squat video.
